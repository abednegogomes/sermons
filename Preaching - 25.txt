Love your neighbour


Please help your fellow neighbour out there, if you see someone down on their luck, give them a hand up and GOD will reward you for it in due time.

Matthew 22:39 Amplified Bible:

> **The second is like it, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself [that is, unselfishly seek the best or higher good for others].’**
