Love.


Matthew 22:36-40 (AMPC):

> Teacher, which kind of commandment is great and important (the principal kind) in the Law? [Some commandments are light—which are heavy?]

> And He replied to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind (intellect).

> This is the great (most important, principal) and first commandment.

> And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as [you do] yourself.

> These two commandments sum up and upon them depend all the Law and the Prophets.


**1. OK, so, how to love GOD with all our heart, soul and mind?**

We need to put away all idols, i.e. all the things that we consider more important than GOD in our lives. Things like our phones, TVs, computers, cars, hobbies, work, romantic partners, children, food, social media, reddit and so on must *not* take first place in our lives and be reduced in priority. The first thing we do each day should be to spend some time praying, reading our Bible or worshiping with hymns or music.


**2. OK, so, how to love others?**

Ephesians 4:31-32 (AMPC):

> Let all bitterness and indignation and wrath (passion, rage, bad temper) and resentment (anger, animosity) and quarreling (brawling, clamor, contention) and slander (evil-speaking, abusive or blasphemous language) be banished from you, with all malice (spite, ill will, or baseness of any kind).

> And become useful and helpful and kind to one another, tenderhearted (compassionate, understanding, loving-hearted), forgiving one another [readily and freely], as God in Christ forgave you.


Those believers with the Holy Spirit living in them, should be able to see the fruit of the Holy Spirit in their lives if they are living in daily submission to GOD:

Galatians 5:22-23 (AMPC):

> But the fruit of the [Holy] Spirit [the work which His presence within accomplishes] is love, joy (gladness), peace, patience (an even temper, forbearance), kindness, goodness (benevolence), faithfulness, Gentleness (meekness, humility), self-control (self-restraint, continence). Against such things there is no law [that can bring a charge].
