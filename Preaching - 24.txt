Show concern for your fellow believers in CHRIST


John 2:17 Amplified Bible:

> **His disciples remembered that it is written [in the Scriptures], “ZEAL (love, concern) FOR YOUR HOUSE [and its honor] WILL CONSUME ME.”**

When was the last time _you_ felt love and concern for GOD's House, or His Church more specifically, who are actually the people, the believers in JESUS?
