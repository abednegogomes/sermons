Faith


**Matthew 17:20 Amplified Bible:**

> He answered, “Because of your little faith [your lack of trust and confidence in the power of God]; for I assure you and most solemnly say to you, if you have [living] faith the size of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and [if it is God’s will] it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.

If your faith is in a GOD who created mountains, then no obstacle (spiritual or physical) is too large for Him to move.
