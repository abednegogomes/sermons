What happens when we reject GOD


**Jeremiah 2:17 Amplified Bible:**

> “Have you not brought this on yourself

> By abandoning (rejecting) the Lord your God

> When He led you in the way?


The worst thing that can happen to you (and to the rest of humanity) is GOD allowing you to self-destruct by experiencing life apart from GOD's protecting hand and wisdom.

**Romans 1:28-31 Amplified Bible:**

> And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God or consider Him worth knowing [as their Creator], God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do things which are improper and repulsive, until they were filled (permeated, saturated) with every kind of unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice and mean-spiritedness. They are gossips [spreading rumors], slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors [of new forms] of evil, disobedient and disrespectful to parents, without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful [without pity]. 


**Romans 1:24-25 Amplified Bible:**

> Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their own hearts to [sexual] impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them [abandoning them to the degrading power of sin], because [by choice] they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.


That's why it's important to believe in JESUS, submit to His Lordship every day of your life and have His HOLY SPIRIT dwelling in your heart. Then the fruits of the SPIRIT will grow in your life.


**Galatians 5:22-23 Amplified Bible:**

> But the fruit of the Spirit [the result of His presence within us] is love [unselfish concern for others], joy, [inner] peace, patience [not the ability to wait, but how we act while waiting], kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such things there is no law. 


You're either in the world (the flesh), or in the SPIRIT. There are no half measures.


**Romans 8:6-8 Amplified Bible:**

Now the mind of the flesh is death [both now and forever—because it pursues sin]; but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace [the spiritual well-being that comes from walking with God—both now and forever]; the mind of the flesh [with its sinful pursuits] is actively hostile to God. It does not submit itself to God’s law, since it cannot, and those who are in the flesh [living a life that caters to sinful appetites and impulses] cannot please God.
