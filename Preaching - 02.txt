Restitution


John 5:5-9 (Amplified Bible):

> There was a certain man there who had been ill for thirty-eight years. When Jesus noticed him lying there [helpless], knowing that he had been in that condition a long time, He said to him, “Do you want to get well?” The invalid answered, “Sir, I have no one to put me in the pool when the water is stirred up, and while I am coming [to get into it myself], someone else steps down ahead of me.” Jesus said to him, “Get up; pick up your pallet and walk.” Immediately the man was healed and recovered his strength, and picked up his pallet and walked.

Has anyone ever asked Jesus for healing and gotten it? Or is the doctor (or hospital) your first port of call? 

One of the best ways to get proof of the existence of GOD is *answered prayer*. I want to set a challenge for all of the atheists, agnostics, unbelievers and even Christians here to offer up a verbal prayer to Jesus and ask Him to heal you of something bothering you. Something simple like saying out loud: "Lord Jesus, please heal my {sore back}, thank You, Amen."

Your faith (the prayer) should be enough for your miracle. Maybe the answer will come straight away, or in the coming days, but _it will come_. If you post your prayer request (you can be vague if it's a sensitive issue), we can come into agreement for it with you, as per Matthew 18:19 (Amplified Bible):

> “Again I say to you, that if two believers on earth agree [that is, are of one mind, in harmony] about anything that they ask [within the will of God], it will be done for them by My Father in heaven.

When you get your miraculous healing, you will know the truth of this verse in John 14:6 (Amplified Bible) and so you can give thanks to Him and give your heart to Him so you can have eternal life.

> Jesus said to him, “I am the [only] Way [to God] and the [real] Truth and the [real] Life; no one comes to the Father but through Me.
