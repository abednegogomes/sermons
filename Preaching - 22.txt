Speak the verses aloud


The power of GOD's Word is when it is spoken and heard aloud, this allows it to reach your heart and grow in there (Matthew 13:23). Speak these verses aloud about yourself and your situation, then thank GOD for the victory in your life, then look to see what He will do for you.

James 4:7-8 Amplified Bible:

> **So submit to [the authority of] God. Resist the devil [stand firm against him] and he will flee from you.**

> **Come close to God [with a contrite heart] and He will come close to you. Wash your hands, you sinners; and purify your [unfaithful] hearts, you double-minded [people].**

Mark 1:8 Amplified Bible:

> **As for me, I baptized you [who came to me] with water [only]; but He will baptize you [who truly repent] with the Holy Spirit.”**

Philippians 4:13 Amplified Bible:

> **I can do all things [which He has called me to do] through Him who strengthens and empowers me [to fulfill His purpose—I am self-sufficient in Christ’s sufficiency; I am ready for anything and equal to anything through Him who infuses me with inner strength and confident peace.]**
