The LORD is GOD in the heavens above


Deuteronomy 4:14-17 Amplified Bible:

> **The Lord commanded me at that time to teach you the statutes and judgments, so that you might do them in the land which you are going over to possess. “So pay attention and watch yourselves carefully—for you did not see any form [of God] on the day the Lord spoke to you at Horeb from the midst of the fire— so that you do not act corruptly and make for yourselves a carved or sculpted image [to worship] in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female, the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, or of any winged bird that flies in the sky,**

The meaning of this is that we shouldn't make anything to worship and we shouldn't worship anything that is made, and we shouldn't worship people. We should only worship GOD in Heaven, who is invisible to us at the moment. Avoid anyone (or anything) forcing you to worship it or an image of it.
