The true Vine


John 15:2-3 Amplified Bible:

> **Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes away; and every branch that continues to bear fruit, He [repeatedly] prunes, so that it will bear more fruit [even richer and finer fruit]. You are already clean because of the word which I have given you [the teachings which I have discussed with you].**


John 15:14 Amplified Bible:

> **You are my friends if you _keep on doing what I command you_.**


John 15:17 Amplified Bible:

> **This [is what] I command you: that you _love and unselfishly seek the best for one another_.**


John 15:23 Amplified Bible:

> **The one who hates Me also hates My Father.**
