LORD of all


The meaning of life is not what you think, it is to follow GOD's commandments and surrender your heart to JESUS for He alone can forgive your sins and give you eternal life.

Ecclesiastes 12:13 Amplified Bible:

> **When all has been heard, the end of the matter is: fear God [worship Him with awe-filled reverence, knowing that He is almighty God] and keep His commandments, for this applies to every person.**

John 3:16 Amplified Bible:

> **“For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.**

1 Timothy 4:10 Amplified Bible:

> **It is for this that we labor and strive [often called to account], because we have fixed our [confident] hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe [in Him, recognize Him as the Son of God, and accept Him as Savior and Lord].**
