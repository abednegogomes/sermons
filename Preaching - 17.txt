Righteousness


**John 4:14 Amplified Bible, Classic Edition:**

> But whoever takes a drink of the water that I will give him shall never, no never, be thirsty any more. But the water that I will give him shall become a spring of water welling up (flowing, bubbling) [continually] within him unto (into, for) eternal life.

At this point, when we give our lives and hearts to JESUS, we must try (with the help of the HOLY SPIRIT) dwelling in us, to stay righteous and live pure in this godless, sinful world we're living in. For us living in the world today, this can be an almost impossible task, e.g. seeing various things on the internet, seeing some inappropriate content on social media, or seeing some scantily clad woman out in public or on a billboard. However we have to *try* avoid that kind of stuff with our eyes which is pretty hard to do. And we need to have faith in JESUS continually cleansing us from all unrighteousness when we confess we have messed up.

**Matthew 5:28 Amplified Bible:**

> but I say to you that everyone who [so much as] looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 

But:

**1 John 1:9 Amplified Bible, Classic Edition:**

> If we [freely] admit that we have sinned and confess our sins, He is faithful and just (true to His own nature and promises) and will forgive our sins [dismiss our lawlessness] and [continuously] cleanse us from all unrighteousness [everything not in conformity to His will in purpose, thought, and action].

Some tips:

- It helps to install ad-blockers in your browsers, e.g. if Chrome doesn't allow them anymore, I switched my desktop and phone to Firefox and put uBlock Origin on.
- Don't frequent inappropriate sites. You know what I'm talking about mainly. But also if there are subreddits that contain a lot of inappropriate content, just don't go to them anymore. And make sure to hide NSFW stuff by default in the settings. 
- For social media, hide feeds from (or unfollow) people that wear revealing clothing to not tempt you into sinning.
- In public, try avoid looking at people's bodies, especially if they're wearing revealing clothing, look people in the eyes, or not at all by focusing straight ahead.

Just because we are saved, does not give us the right to abuse GOD's grace willfully. Check out this verse in Jude.

**Jude 4 Amplified Bible, Classic Edition:**

> For certain men have crept in stealthily [gaining entrance secretly by a side door]. Their doom was predicted long ago, ungodly (impious, profane) persons who pervert the grace (the spiritual blessing and favor) of our God into lawlessness and wantonness and immorality, and disown and deny our sole Master and Lord, Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One).

If this is you, it's time to stop being a lukewarm Christian. Get down on your knees and repent. Then every day you're submitting yourself to GOD, resisting the devil (James 4:7) and asking for HOLY SPIRIT's help to stay pure. Ask Him specifically to take captive every thought to make it obedient to CHRIST (2 Corinthians 10:5). 

**Revelation 3:15-18 Amplified Bible:**

> ‘I know your deeds, that you are neither cold (invigorating, refreshing) nor hot (healing, therapeutic); I wish that you were cold or hot. So because you are lukewarm (spiritually useless), and neither hot nor cold, I will vomit you out of My mouth [rejecting you with disgust]. Because you say, “I am rich, and have prospered and grown wealthy, and have need of nothing,” and you do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked [without hope and in great need], I counsel you to buy from Me gold that has been heated red hot and refined by fire so that you may become truly rich; and white clothes [representing righteousness] to clothe yourself so that the shame of your nakedness will not be seen; and healing salve to put on your eyes so that you may see.

Don't get vomited out before the rapture.
