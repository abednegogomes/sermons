Fear GOD


The meaning of our lives cannot be determined by the world, nor other people, it is GOD alone who determines our value and purpose.

**Ecclesiastes 12:13 Amplified Bible:**

> When all has been heard, the end of the matter is: fear God [worship Him with awe-filled reverence, knowing that He is almighty God] and keep His commandments, for this applies to every person. 

Get to know Him today. Talk with Him today. Get into a quiet space by yourself. Turn the TV, phone, music etc off. Pray a simple prayer out loud like this: "JESUS, please talk to me today." Listen back for His response. You can respond back verbally, which helps solidify your thinking. Soon you will realise that voice in your mind you were hearing was not your own, but His. Keep up the conversation throughout the day. You can talk about anything.

For those who don't believe, you can also say this "Please give me a sign that You are real today." and see what happens.
