Relinquishing control and submission to GOD


How many here are Christians, but don't daily submit themselves to GOD? This verse in James 4:7 Amplified Bible says: 

> So submit to [the authority of] God. Resist the devil [stand firm against him] and he will flee from you. 

We may call ourselves Christians, but if we're not living in daily submission to GOD, we're just doing our own thing which is living for ourself, possibly living in sin and not actually producing anything of use for the Kingdom of GOD. We may have prayed the sinner's prayer a while ago when we first became Christians, but now we are actually just luke-warm if we are living like this.

This verse in Ephesians 4:22-24 (Amplified Bible) says:

> that, regarding your previous way of life, you put off your old self [completely discard your former nature], which is being corrupted through deceitful desires, and be continually renewed in the spirit of your mind [having a fresh, untarnished mental and spiritual attitude], and put on the new self [the regenerated and renewed nature], created in God’s image, [godlike] in the righteousness and holiness of the truth [living in a way that expresses to God your gratitude for your salvation].

We also must do this as per Galatians 5:24 (Amplified Bible):

> And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the sinful nature together with its passions and appetites.

And Ephesians 4:22 (Amplified Bible):

> that, regarding your previous way of life, you put off your old self [completely discard your former nature], which is being corrupted through deceitful desires, 

And in 1 Corinthians 6:20 (Amplified Bible):

> You were bought with a price [you were actually purchased with the precious blood of Jesus and made His own]. So then, honor and glorify God with your body.

So, doing this should produce fruit in us as per Galatians 5:22-23 (Amplified Bible):

> But the fruit of the Spirit [the result of His presence within us] is love [unselfish concern for others], joy, [inner] peace, patience [not the ability to wait, but how we act while waiting], kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such things there is no law. 

If you're struggling with lust, pornography, or any other sin, it's because you're not living in daily submission to GOD and His HOLY SPIRIT, who should be living inside of you. Start living in victory over sin and overpowering your fleshly carnal nature. A three day fast from food is a great way to gain some authority in this area.

And also pray a simple prayer each morning, something like this:

Dear Heavenly FATHER,

I submit myself to You today in unreserved obedience and I resist the devil.
Create in me a clean heart, O GOD, and renew a right and steadfast spirit within me.
I invite Your HOLY SPIRIT to work in me, through me and to use me to bring Your Kingdom to earth.

In Your mighty name LORD JESUS,
Amen.
