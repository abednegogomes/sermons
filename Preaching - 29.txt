Great and mighty


Joshua 4:

> 2-3. **“Take for yourselves the twelve men [chosen] from among the people, one man from each tribe, and command them, ‘Pick up for yourselves twelve stones [one each] from here out of the midst of the Jordan, from the place where the priests’ feet are standing firm; carry them over with you and lay them down at the place where you will spend the night tonight.’”**

> 13. **about 40,000 [men] armed and equipped for war crossed for battle before the Lord to the desert plains of Jericho.**

> 21. **He said to the sons of Israel, “When your children ask their fathers in time to come, ‘What do these stones mean?’**

> 22. **then you shall let your children know, ‘Israel crossed this Jordan on dry ground.’**

> 23. **For the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan for you until you crossed over, just as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed;**

> 24. **so that all the peoples of the earth may know [without any doubt] and acknowledge that the hand of the Lord is mighty and extraordinarily powerful, so that you will fear the Lord your God [and obey and worship Him with profound awe and reverence] forever.”**
 
We serve a great and mighty GOD, The CREATOR of the heavens and the earth. _Nothing_ is impossible for Him. He sits outside time and space, infinite in power and majesty. And He loves _you_ and wants a personal relationship with _you_. Ask Him to talk to you _today_.

All hail KING JESUS, **KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS**!
