Demons and witchcraft


I have actually seen a demon (evil spirit) with my own eyes. One night in 2022, we had come home from a standard deliverance night at church in Rio de Janeiro. For some reason I felt I needed to anoint my bedroom, like we might come under a witchcraft attack. So I got the oil and did that, anointing the doors, windows, mirrors, bed and ourselves. So my wife and I went to bed as normal.

We were sleeping fine. Then I heard an audible voice in my ear saying, "Bob, wake up!" with urgency in the voice. I knew it to be JESUS. (NB: I'm using Bob instead of my real name here). So I woke up and looked around the room. The room was somewhat dark, but light from the streetlights outside were shining through the curtains. There, about 2 meters from the end of the bed, on my side was a dark shadowy figure. Very tall, approximately 7 feet maybe, standing at attention. I couldn't make out any features or anything due to the dark. I thought to myself "Oh hell, that doesn't look good". Then pretty much instinctively I yelled out quickly "SAI, em nome de JESUS!" which means "Get out in the name of JESUS". And just like that, it disappeared instantly, within a split second. My wife woke up startled and our 2 year old next to us too, wondering what was going on. After explaining what I saw to my wife, she noped out of there and wanted to sleep in the spare bedroom after that.

Afterwards, I had turned on the light and I looked over on the floor, where the demon (evil spirit / fallen angel) was before. There I could see a soft toy monkey on the floor. I knew this toy to be my our granddaughter's favourite toy, and at some point in the past she must have taken it to her (other) grandmother's house, who just so happened to be a spiritist (or macumbeira as they call them in Brazil). So maybe she performed some kind of witchcraft on the toy, which gave the evil spirit legal right for entry to our home, then it came in via astral projection. That's my educated guess what happened after I have since read various spiritual warfare books. So anyway, that toy went straight down the apartment's garbage chute, along with any other toys from the grandmother.

So that is my story of seeing a demonic/evil spirit with my own eyes. I have also seen countless people manifesting with evil spirits in the churches in Brazil, especially on deliverance days. They cannot resist the power and presence of the HOLY SPIRIT.

- In some cases they are flailing around, screaming loudly, like they are in torture. Some require 4-5 ushers to hold the people before they can cast the demon(s) out of them.
- In a lot of cases, where the person has been involved in witchcraft (the occult), or addiction to hard drugs or smoking they also manifest. I wouldn't have believed it, or thought they were acting or getting paid, but my own wife manifested a few times on separate occasions. I suspect because she was smoker at the time.
- On one occasion in church, I saw a guy with his hands behind his back, which looked like they were forcibly bound not of his own accord and he was slithering along the floor side to side like a snake. He was just slithering towards us and I was just standing there watching with my son before some people took him to the altar to get prayed for.
- On two separate occasions now (in different churches) I have been standing in the middle of the pew, and some guy on the end of the pew near the aisle has been standing there. Then, all of a sudden, someone (or something), maybe an angel, pushes them forcefully out into the aisle and they start manifesting there, growling and flailing around, like not conscious anymore, their head moving in a circular motion. One time they took the person to the front near the altar, and interrogated the demons in him and they said their name was 'legion', which I think means many demons in them.

So, you can take my word for it, witchcraft is real, demons are real, angels are real, the Bible is real, GOD is real, JESUS is real, and He loves You. However JESUS CHRIST is more powerful than any witch, warlock, witchcraft, or evil spirit: 

> Which He exerted in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His [own] right hand in the heavenly [places],
> Far above all rule and authority and power and dominion and every name that is named [above every title that can be conferred], not only in this age and in this world, but also in the age and the world which are to come.

- Ephesians 1:20-21 Amplified Bible, Classic Edition

There is power in the name of JESUS and protection for believers. And we, as believers have authority over all the powers of darkness.

> Behold! I have given you authority and power to trample upon serpents and scorpions, and [physical and mental strength and ability] over all the power that the enemy [possesses]; and nothing shall in any way harm you.

- Luke 10:19 Amplified Bible, Classic Edition

So *use that authority if you have to* in any emergency situation. 

If you don't believe any of my eye witness testimony I have written here, I challenge you to go to a local deliverance service and see for yourself with your own eyes. There should be one in your city. Or you can find some channels on YouTube and watch e.g. maybe channels Vlad Savchuk or Daniel Adams. There is similar manifestations going on there to what I have seen in person in the churches in Brazil.
