the Way Home


The power of the gospel is in its Truth. Because [**JESUS is the only Way to God and the real Truth and the real Life**](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A6&version=AMP). Forget everything else you know and go find the Way the Truth and the Life. Everything is through Him. Everything is by Him. [**He is the gateway**](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010%3A7&version=AMP) to heaven and eternal life. [Repent of your sins you sinners](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%204%3A8&version=AMP), turn your hearts to Him.
