What are you placing your trust in?


John 5:4 Amplified Bible, Classic Edition:

> For an angel of the Lord went down at appointed seasons into the pool and moved and stirred up the water; whoever then first, after the stirring up of the water, stepped in was cured of whatever disease with which he was afflicted.

This is an interesting verse, it appears in the Amplified Bible, but does not appear in my NIV study Bible in place (i.e. I can see verse 3 and 5, but not verse 4), but the study Bible does have a footnote down below saying:

> Verse 4 was doubtless inserted by a later copyist to explain why people waited by the pool in large numbers.

This is an interesting point, was it really an angel that stirred the waters? Or did the people just believe it was an angel stirring the waters but it was actually some natural phenomenon like water from a higher pool filling the lower pool. Was this addition by the scribe that it really was an angel, inspired scripture from the HOLY SPIRIT? Or was it added erroneously?

Anyway, as we see later in the chapter, JESUS could heal the man without the water at all, in John 5:8-9 (AMPC):

> Jesus said to him, Get up! Pick up your bed (sleeping pad) and walk!

> Instantly the man became well and recovered his strength and picked up his bed and walked. But that happened on the Sabbath.

I think, in this life, people are misplacing their hope when it comes to healing and other things in their life. Their placing their hope in healing water. They're placing it in angels. Or they're placing it in idols. They're placing it in spirit guides (demons). They're placing it in witchcraft. They're placing it in medicines. They're placing it in herbs. They're placing it in creams and salts. They're placing it in doctors. They're placing it in hospitals. They're placing it in equipment. They're placing it in advice from their phones. They're placing it in advice from AI (large language models like ChatGPT which are outdated, incorrect 5-70% of the time and sometimes just fabricate things which they nickname "hallucination"). They're placing it in everything, **but** JESUS (the Way, the Truth and the Life).

Here's your verse and challenge for today:

**Psalm 42:11 Amplified Bible, Classic Edition:**

Why are you cast down, O my inner self? And why should you moan over me and be disquieted within me? Hope in God and wait expectantly for Him, for I shall yet praise Him, Who is the help of my countenance, and my God.
