The meaning of life


The meaning of this life is to follow JESUS and obey His commandments. Because humanity failed so badly at this, GOD had to send His one and only SON, JESUS, so that anyone who believes in Him can have eternal life. Now we are in a final waiting stage to convince as many souls as possible to follow JESUS (the easy way). Prophecy markers for the return of CHRIST are being fulfilled. The stubborn, hard hearted ones will miss the rapture and have to experience the great tribulation and suffering (the hard way).

If you want to follow JESUS and have meaning for your life, truly repent to GOD for your sins, give your life to JESUS and get baptised (with water). Ask for His HOLY SPIRIT to live inside of you (baptism with the HOLY SPIRIT). It's as simple as that.

A lot of Christians try to live righteous lives in their own strength. Nobody is perfect and this is impossible without the help of the HOLY SPIRIT living inside of us.
