The power of praise


This is a difficult concept to grasp but it's the only way to victory in your life. There are a number of stories in the Bible where praise has brought the victory or release from captivity. Here are a few:

> [Joshua 5:13-6:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%205%3A13-6%3A27&version=AMP): The priests blew the trumpets and the people raised a great shout and the wall [of Jericho] fell down, so that the sons of Israel went up into the city, every man straight ahead [climbing over the rubble], and they overthrew the city.

> [Judges 7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges%207&version=AMP): When three companies blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers, they held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow, and they shouted, "A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!" and the entire Midianite army ran, crying out as they fled.

> [Acts 16:16-40](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2016%3A16-40&version=AMP): Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God, then suddenly there was a great earthquake, so [powerful] that the very foundations of the prison were shaken and at once all the doors were opened and everyone's chains were unfastened.

The key is not relying on your own strength, knowledge, wisdom or understanding but placing your problem in GOD's Hands and giving Him the glory and He will help you. There is truth in these verses:

**1 Thessalonians 5:18 Amplified Bible:**

> in every situation [no matter what the circumstances] be thankful and continually give thanks to God; for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus.

**Psalm 22:3 King James Version:**

> But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.

When you give thanks for everything GOD has done for you in your life and worship, this is where you will sense GOD's presence and miracle working power in your life. One of my favourite songs is [Raise a Hallelujah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awkO61T6i0k), you can sense the anointing of the HOLY SPIRIT in this song. But of course, feel free to use your own worship music. The point is, anytime you feel you're in a spiritual battle, or struggling, or going through something difficult, is to put on some worship music and the heaviness will lift off. Soon you will see GOD's provision, restoration and blessing in your life again. Giving GOD thanks and praise allows Him to work in your circumstances. We may not understand what we're going through or why, much like Job, but be sure GOD causes all things to work together [as a plan] for good for those who love Him (Romans 8:28). We can also pray a short prayer like this:

> "Thank You FATHER GOD for this problem [situation / circumstances] I have. I know that You will work all things together for good, so I release it into Your Hands, may Your will be done. In Your mighty name, LORD JESUS, and by Your power HOLY SPIRIT, amen."
