Pray


The power of JESUS's name, is _powerful_. For those in CHRIST, you have authority in His name, so **start using it**.

Luke 10:19 Amplified Bible, Classic Edition:

> **Behold! I have given you authority and power to trample upon serpents and scorpions, and [physical and mental strength and ability] over all the power that the enemy [possesses]; and nothing shall in any way harm you.**

John 16:24 Amplified Bible, Classic Edition:

> **Up to this time you have not asked a [single] thing in My Name [as presenting all that I AM]; but now ask and keep on asking and you will receive, so that your joy (gladness, delight) may be full and complete.**

> John 16:26 Amplified Bible, Classic Edition:

> **At that time you will ask (pray) in My Name; and I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf [for it will be unnecessary].**

The kingdom of darkness has **no** power over us. **None.** The witches, warlocks, satanists and other occultists are wasting their time and efforts. I want to introduce you to a prayer, it's called the [Declaration of Confidence in GOD's Protection](https://www.derekprince.com/cards/c-pc01-100), from Derek Prince Ministries, which you should pray **out loud** every day if you can. Pray it for your family too:

> **No weapon that is formed against me shall prosper and every tongue that arises against me in judgment I do condemn**. This is my heritage as a servant of the Lord and my righteousness is from You, O Lord of Hosts.

> If there are those who have been speaking or praying against me, or seeking to harm me, or who have rejected me, **I forgive them** (_name people if you know them_). Having forgiven them, I bless them in the name of the Lord.

> Now I declare, O LORD, that You and You alone are my God and beside You there is no other; a just God and a Savior, the Father, the Son and the Spirit, and I worship You!

> **I submit myself afresh to You today in unreserved obedience**. Having submitted to You, Lord, I do as Your Word directs. **I resist the devil: all his pressures, his attacks, his deceptions, and every instrument or agent he would seek to use against me**. I do not submit! I resist him, drive him from me and exclude him from me in the name of Jesus.

> Specifically I reject and repel: infirmity, infection, pain, inflammation, malignancies, allergies, viruses, (_name any sickness or spirits that you feel have been coming against you_), every form of witchcraft and every type of stress.

> Finally, LORD, I thank You that through the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross, I have passed out from under the curse and entered into the blessing of Abraham whom You blessed in all things: exaltation, health, reproductiveness, prosperity, victory, God’s favor, and God’s friendship.

> In the mighty name of my LORD, SAVIOUR and KING, JESUS CHRIST of Nazareth,

> Amen.
