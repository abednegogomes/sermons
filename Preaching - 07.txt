JESUS loves you.


JESUS loves _you_.

Countless scriptures in the Bible point to this fact. In reality, He died for our sins according to the Scriptures. But GOD demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, CHRIST died for us. In fact He would die _just for you_ because _you_ are that special to Him (see the parable of the lost sheep). You only need to accept Him as your LORD and Saviour to be saved and have eternal life in Heaven when you die.

Because where else are you going to go when you die? Ever thought about that? Do you think you'll just cease to exist? Just blackness and nothing? Or do you believe in some kind of afterlife? But how will you qualify for that, and do you really think it's true?

The only true thing we have is the Word of GOD.

John 1:1-5, 14 Amplified Bible:

> **The Deity of Jesus Christ**

> In the beginning [before all time] was the Word (Christ), and the Word was with God, and the Word was God Himself. He was [continually existing] in the beginning [co-eternally] with God. All things were made and came into existence through Him; and without Him not even one thing was made that has come into being. In Him was life [and the power to bestow life], and the life was the Light of men. The Light shines on in the darkness, and the darkness did not understand it or overpower it or appropriate it or absorb it [and is unreceptive to it].

John 1:14 Amplified Bible:

> And the Word (Christ) became flesh, and lived among us; and we [actually] saw His glory, glory as belongs to the [One and] only begotten Son of the Father, [the Son who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, who is] full of grace and truth (absolutely free of deception).

John 1:29 Amplified Bible:

> The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, “Look! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!
