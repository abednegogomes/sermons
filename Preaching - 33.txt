Prayer


Matthew 18:19 Amplified Bible:

> **“Again I say to you, that if two believers on earth agree [that is, are of one mind, in harmony] about anything that they ask [within the will of God], it will be done for them by My Father in heaven.**

Anyone need prayer for anything in your life? Write out your problem or issue, or write a short prayer and I'll pray it with you. Every single one.


Bonus:

1 Timothy 2:1-5 Amplified Bible:

> **A Call to Prayer**

> **First of all, then, I urge that petitions (specific requests), prayers, intercessions (prayers for others) and thanksgivings be offered on behalf of all people, for kings and all who are in [positions of] high authority, so that we may live a peaceful and quiet life in all godliness and dignity. This [kind of praying] is good and acceptable and pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, who wishes all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge and recognition of the [divine] truth. For there is [only] one God, and [only] one Mediator between God and mankind, the Man Christ Jesus,**

If anyone wants to write a short prayer or request for their leaders in their country go for it as well.
