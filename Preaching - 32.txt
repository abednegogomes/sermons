An encounter with The KING


The main reason people truly believe is because they have had an encounter with JESUS. A real encounter. Because He **is** alive and He **is** real. If you would like a personal encounter with Him, simply ask Him to meet you where you're at and make Himself real to you. Simply ask out loud (as an act of faith).

Matthew 7:7-8 Amplified Bible:

> **“Ask and keep on asking and it will be given to you; seek and keep on seeking and you will find; knock and keep on knocking and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who keeps on asking receives, and he who keeps on seeking finds, and to him who keeps on knocking, it will be opened.**

*NB: If there are any believers on here, feel free to share any encounters or spiritual experiences you've had with the LORD. This will encourage others to seek Him too.*
