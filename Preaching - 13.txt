Prophecy


The power of prophecy is to foretell future events, to outline GOD's direction for our lives, and to encourage others with what GOD wants to reveal to them.

The point of this post is to encourage _you_ to verify what you hear with the Bible scriptures. And take everything you hear to HOLY SPIRIT to get confirmation that something is specifically for you.

There are a lot of Youtube channels out there that contain prophetic messages, but they are relying on Youtube algorithms to spread that content to various people. You will find them asking for likes and subscribes (to grow their channel audience), also more directly joining their channel and giving a "Thanks" (a way for them to earn money). Some ask for money every video which is quite grating on the ears. I think a word of caution is valid here. Are they doing this work unto the LORD (out of obedience to GOD, or love for GOD, or sharing the love of CHRIST), or are they doing it unto mammon (to get immediate financial reward and earn a living from making content)? Don't fall into this trap. You are not obligated to give to these channels just because they ask. If they want to leave a donate (Thanks) button on the video, or a comment in the description to donate, that is ok, you can if you want to. But asking for money in every video is a bit much. Let the HOLY SPIRIT guide you in your giving. Don't feel compelled or under pressure from others.

**Matthew 6:24 Amplified Bible:**

“No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon [money, possessions, fame, status, or whatever is valued more than the Lord].

**James 1:27 Amplified Bible:**

> Pure and unblemished religion [as it is expressed in outward acts] in the sight of our God and Father is this: to visit and look after the fatherless and the widows in their distress, and to keep oneself uncontaminated by the [secular] world.

**Matthew 25:34-36 Amplified Bible:**

> “Then the King will say to those on His right, ‘Come, you blessed of My Father [you favored of God, appointed to eternal salvation], inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry, and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me something to drink; I was a stranger, and you invited Me in; I was naked, and you clothed Me; I was sick, and you visited Me [with help and ministering care]; I was in prison, and you came to Me [ignoring personal danger].’

That said, I have found a few YouTube channels which are bringing good prophetic messages and seem to be hearing from GOD individually (e.g. FATHER, SON or HOLY SPIRIT) and do not appear concerned about money. I will put these here:

- HOLY SPIRIT: Alwyn Uys - @AlwynUys
- LORD JESUS: We Are The Saints - @wearethesaintslive
- FATHER GOD: Unknown Prophet - @UnknownProphet77

Have a listen to some of their videos, I'm sure it will be helpful for you. There are other good channels out there I'm sure, GOD is not limited to speaking through just a few people. Another one that I think is good for keeping up with current events and end times prophecy is Randy Kay's channel - @HeavenEncounterswithRandyKay.
