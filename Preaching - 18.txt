Hubris


Dear fellow redditors,

Are you guilty of hubris? Not just hubris in general, but hubris against GOD. What is hubris you say? Well it's exaggerated pride or self-confidence, arrogance basically. And we could define it as excessive pride towards or defiance of GOD, sometimes leading to divine retribution, see [Acts 12:21-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2012%3A21-23&version=AMP).

Countless examples in the Bible point to pride being people's downfall. Imagine Adam, the first human, mere dust, formed from the dust of the ground and it was the LORD GOD that breathed life into his nostrils the breath of life (Genesis 2:7). Now imagine GOD, outside our space and time, who created everything in existence. He is *so* much greater and infinite than we can even imagine. We are not greater than our Creator. Nor are we more knowledgeable about how to run our own life. We actually need His help. We actually need GOD in our lives. We need relationship with Him.

For example, what happens when we don't follow GOD's Wisdom? We can find wisdom all through the Bible, particularly in Proverbs. However those who don't follow wisdom often end up in trouble. Contrast [Proverbs 7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs%207&version=AMP) and [Proverbs 8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs%208&version=AMP).

Repent of Your pride, arrogance and hubris and try trusting in GOD for a change. I have and it makes all the difference.

**Proverbs 8:35-36 Amplified Bible:**

> “For whoever finds me (Wisdom) finds life

> And obtains favor and grace from the LORD.
 
> But he who fails to find me or sins against me injures himself;

> All those who hate me love and court death.”
